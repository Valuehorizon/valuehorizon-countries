Countries, by Valuehorizon
==============

A Django-based Countries data toolkit. 
It also includes documentation, test coverage and the official ISO 3166 seed data.
This app is a part of the Valuehorizon application ecosystem.

Note: this app is not a fork of the excellent django-countries_ app. The aim of
this app is to provide similar functionality but to actually include a Country model. 
From an architecture point-of-view, we prefer this method as we can make ORM queries.
Also, the data is part of the database, and is not hard-coded in our source-code.
